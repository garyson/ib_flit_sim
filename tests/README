This directory contains tests for the IB flit-level simulation.  It is
intended to aid refactoring/rework of the model, so that we can have
confidence that making changes to the model will not break fundamental
assumptions/invariants of our model.  These tests use the opp_test
framework described in Chapter 15 of the OMNet++ User Manual [1].

Each test file starts with a %description block containing a brief
description of what the test does.

Each test file contains a NED file which contains a "network" type,
which is automatically loaded by the test framework.  In most cases, this
contains as a submodule a simple module with a corresponding .cc file
that implements the behavior of the test.

The lib/ directory contains some shared OMNet++ modules and other
classes which are used to implement some useful behavior that may be
shared among tests.
