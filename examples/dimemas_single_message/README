Files in this directory:

 - trace.prv, trace.pcf, trace.row: The Paraver trace generated by
   Extrae along with associated metadata files.

 - dimemas.cfg: A configuration file describing the network and task
   layout to Dimemas.  Can be modified to make some adjustments to the
   properties of the network, but should be kept consistent with the
   OMNet++ representations.

 - test.ned: Network description file for OMNet++, which creates the
   needed model objects and their connections.

 - test.fdbs: The filtering database (a.k.a. routing table) for every
   switch in the topology.

 - omnetpp.ini: The configuration file for OMNet++ which references the
   above files and provides some additional configuration.  This
   references some other INI files in the source distribution.

 - ranks.txt: A mapping of MPI ranks to LID/QPN.  Each line specifies the
   LID followed by the QPN for that MPI rank in sequence.

 - example-mpi-program.c: The MPI program that generated the trace, for
   reference purposes.

Steps to run:

1. Generate the input Dimemas trace:

```
$ prv2dim trace.prv trace.dim
```

2. Ensure Dimemas is built with the Venus client enabled:

```
pushd ${DIMEMAS_SOURCE_DIR}
./configure --enable-venus
make
sudo make install
```

3. In a background terminal window, launch OMNet++:

```
cd examples/test
export NEDPATH=..:../../src
opp_run -l ../../src/libib_flit_sim.so -c One -u Cmdenv
```

You should see a message like this:

> Listening for Dimemas VenusClient connection on localhost:10000

4. Run Dimemas:

```
$ Dimemas -S 32K --dim trace.dim -venus -p predicted.prv dimemas.cfg
```

Both OMNet++ and Dimemas should be making progress.  Eventually both
will complete.  OMNet++ will produce a "results" folder with statistics,
and Dimemas will produce an output trace in the "predicted.prv" file.
