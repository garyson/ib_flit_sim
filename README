This directory tree hold an InfiniBand model with support for
IB flow control scheme, Arbitration over multiple VLs and routing
based on Linear Forwarding Tables.

To run it:
1. make makefiles
2. make

This will make a debug build by default.  To create an optimized build,
add MODE=release like this:

$ make MODE=release

By default, this will build a shared library which is needed by the
testsuite.  To build an executable instead, you need to rebuild the
makefiles:

$ make makefiles-exe

cd into the example dir and look for a */README

For more info regarding each one of the model modules see the doc directory
